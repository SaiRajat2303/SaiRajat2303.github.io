## 🧠 About Me

I'm passionate about **High Peformance Architectures**,**CPU Microarchitecture** and **RTL Design**.  
Currently exploring **Platform level components such as IOMMU** **out-of-order execution**, **CHI/AXI on chip interconnect protocols**, and **open-source hardware frameworks** like BOOM and Rocket Chip.

- 🎯 Focus Areas: *CPU pipelines, cache coherence, AXI4, formal verification*
- 💻 Languages: *SystemVerilog, Verilog, Python, C++*
- 🧩 Tools: *Verilator, Synopsys VCS, Vivado, OpenROAD, OpenSTA*
- 🧾 Aspiring PhD student in **Computer Architecture / VLSI Design**

## 🚀 Projects

### 🔸 [AXI Traffic Generator](https://github.com/yourusername/axi-traffic-generator)
A configurable traffic generator that supports **out-of-order read responses** and randomized transactions.  
Built in SystemVerilog with modular FSMs for AR/R/W channels.

### 🔸 [Out-of-Order R-Channel Handler](https://github.com/yourusername/axi-r-channel-handler)
Implements **reordering logic** for AXI read responses using **ID-based tracking** and **LFSR-driven data generation**.

### 🔸 [BOOM Core Exploration](https://github.com/yourusername/boom-core-research)
Reverse-engineering and modeling the **Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine** in SystemVerilog, focusing on issue queues and branch prediction.
